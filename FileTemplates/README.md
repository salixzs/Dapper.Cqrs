# Dapper.Cqrs new item (file) templates

Here you can find new file templates to create initial boilerplate code for different code files, necessary when using `Dapper.CQRS` package.

> See also [WIKI](https://github.com/salixzs/Dapper.Cqrs/wiki/Productivity) on these and other productivity features and more details.

Download compressed ZIP files found here and copy them over to this folder on your development computer (where Visual Studio is):

```text
%USERPROFILE%\Documents\Visual Studio 2019\Templates\ItemTemplates\Dapper CQRS
```
*(create this subfolder there)*

After Visual Studio restart - right-click menu on C# project/folder "Add..." => "New Item..." should provide new class templates in section "Dapper CQRS" to create initial boilerplate code for IQuery, ICommand and other class files.
